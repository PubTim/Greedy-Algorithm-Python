# Greedy Algorithm Python
 
This is a simple implementation of the Greedy Algorithm.

In this problem, we have the file examplenumbers, which is a file of numbers with fixed columns and a (can be) unlimited number of rows. The goal is to find the hightest total number, going from the top to the bottom. The possible paths from top to bottom are down, diagonally down left or diagonally down right.
